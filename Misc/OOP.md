# Object Oriented Programming Concepts

## Encapsulation

Objects own their state. Other objects interact with that state via methods, not direct access.

## Abstraction

An object should provide methods at a high level of abstraction. Internal workings are the responsibility of the object.

## Inheritance

Common state and methods can be defined in one object, and inherited by others, to reduce repeated code.

## Polymorphism

Objects with inherited methods can override these methods to better suit their own logic.
